    interaction model

Description: The package allows for the Estimation of Sample-size and Power by
    Exploring Simulated Study Outcomes for an interaction model where the
    covariates are two genetic variants (SNPs), an interaction term.
    It supports simulation-based power calculation for stand-alone
    case-control studies and for case-control analyses nested in cohort studies,
    that take account of realistic
    assessment error.
